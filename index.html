            <Ul>
                <li>I. One should strive to act with compassion and empathy toward all creatures in accordance with reason.
                </li>
                <li>II. The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.
                </li>
                <li>III. One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.
                </li>
                <li>IV.The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo one's own.
                </li>
                <li>V. Beliefs should conform to one's best scientific understanding of the world. One should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit one's beliefs.
                </li>
                <li>VI. People are fallible. If one makes a mistake, one should do one's best to rectify it and resolve any harm that might have been caused.
                </li>
                <li>VII. Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word.
                </li>
